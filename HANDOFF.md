## Data Model (Convex schema.ts)

8 tables, all indexed for efficient queries.

- **clubs** — top-level org (DIA). Fields: `name`, `slug`, `createdAt`. Index: `by_slug`
- **teams** — JO12-1, JO13-2, etc. Fields: `clubId` (→clubs), `name`, `slug`, `createdAt`. Indexes: `by_club`, `by_slug` (clubId+slug), `by_slug_only`
- **coaches** — PIN-authenticated, linked to 1+ teams. Fields: `name`, `pin`, `teamIds[]` (→teams), `createdAt`. Index: `by_pin`
- **referees** — global referee records. Fields: `name`, `pin`, `active`, `createdAt`. Index: `by_pin`
- **players** — per team. Fields: `teamId` (→teams), `name`, `number` (shirt), `active`, `positionPrimary` (K/V/M/A), `positionSecondary`, `createdAt`. Index: `by_team`
- **matches** — core entity, status machine (scheduled→lineup→live→halftime→finished). Fields: `teamId` (→teams), `publicCode` (6-char), `coachPin`, `opponent`, `isHome`, `scheduledAt`, `status`, `currentQuarter`, `quarterCount` (2 or 4), `homeScore`, `awayScore`, `showLineup`, `pausedAt`, `accumulatedPauseTime`, `refereeId` (→referees), `leadCoachId` (→coaches), `formationId` (e.g. "8v8_3-3-1"), `pitchType` (full/half), `startedAt`, `quarterStartedAt`, `finishedAt`, `createdAt`. Indexes: `by_team`, `by_code`, `by_status`, `by_refereeId`
- **matchPlayers** — junction: players in a match. Fields: `matchId` (→matches), `playerId` (→players), `isKeeper`, `onField`, `fieldSlotIndex` (pitch position slot), `minutesPlayed`, `lastSubbedInAt`, `createdAt`. Indexes: `by_match`, `by_match_player`, `by_player`
- **matchEvents** — timeline events. Fields: `matchId` (→matches), `type` (goal/assist/sub_in/sub_out/quarter_start/quarter_end/yellow_card/red_card), `playerId`, `relatedPlayerId`, `quarter`, `isOwnGoal`, `isOpponentGoal`, `note`, `timestamp`, `createdAt`. Indexes: `by_match`, `by_match_type`

## Auth Model

Four roles, all PIN-based (no user accounts):

| Role | Auth method | PIN storage | Verification function |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| **Coach** | 4-6 digit PIN | `coaches.pin` | `verifyCoachPin()` — checks `match.coachPin === pin` |
| **Referee** | 4-6 digit PIN | `referees.pin` | `verifyClockPin()` — accepts coach OR assigned referee PIN |
| **Admin** | PIN (env var) | Convex `process.env.ADMIN_PIN` | `verifyAdminPin()` — server-side only, never in client bundle |
| **Public** | 6-char code | `matches.publicCode` | No auth — read-only queries strip sensitive fields |

**Key flows:**
- **Coach login:** PIN → `verifyCoachPin` query → returns coach + teams + matches → session stored client-side
- **Referee login:** PIN → `getMatchesForReferee` query → returns referee + assigned matches → tap match to enter controls
- **Admin login:** PIN → `verifyAdminPinQuery` query (server-side check against Convex env var) → PIN stored in `sessionStorage` via `src/lib/adminSession.ts` → all admin mutations verify PIN server-side
- **Public access:** 6-char code in URL → `getByPublicCode` query → match data (coachPin, refereeId stripped)
- **Clock/score:** `verifyClockPin(match, pin, referee?)` accepts either coach PIN or assigned referee PIN — enables both roles to control the match

## Key Patterns

1. **Real-time via Convex** — `useQuery` auto-subscribes, UI updates instantly when coach makes changes
2. **Public code system** — random 6-char (no ambiguous chars: O/0/I/1 excluded)
3. **Quarter-based match flow** — supports 2 halves or 4 quarters
4. **Event sourcing light** — all match actions logged as events for timeline

## Current State

- Schema defined ✅
- Queries (public view, coach view, referee view) ✅
- Mutations (match lifecycle, goals, subs, clock pause/resume, score adjust) ✅
- Public live page ✅ (with real-time score, lineup, event timeline, pause indicator)
- Coach dashboard ✅ (PIN login, match list, live match control panel)
- Coach match management ✅ (lineup, substitutions, goals with player attribution, playing time tracking)
- Referee role ✅ (separate PIN, clock control, score editing with optional shirt number)
- Clock pause/resume ✅ (mid-quarter pause for injuries/stoppages, affects playing time)
- Seed data ✅ (club DIA, 3 teams, 14 players each, 4 coaches, 4 referees, 3 matches with referee assignments)
- Admin pages ✅ — CRUD for clubs, teams, players, coaches, referees
- Public match browser ✅ (homepage hero element — code input removed, match browser primary, coach/referee login secondary)
- Standen page ✅ (/standen — defaults to today's matches, ?alle=true for all, minimal scoreboard for kantine/tablet)
- Wedstrijdleider ✅ Phase 1 (coaches can claim/release match lead role, informational only)
- Admin match management ✅ (Wedstrijden tab in admin: list/create/edit/delete matches, referee assignment, cascade delete)
- Team match history ✅ (`/team/[slug]/history` — season stats, match list, result badges)
- Position/formation data model ✅ (schema fields + `src/lib/formations.ts` + `src/lib/positions.ts`)
- PitchView field component ✅ (EA FC-style player cards with role colors K=amber/V=blue/M=green/A=red, avatar silhouettes, formation connecting lines, SVG field markings, 3D perspective tilt, tap-to-swap player positions, field-bench substitution, 90px uniform card size, full-field player spread)
- Component tests ✅ (Vitest + RTL — coach login, match controls, live view components, playing time, substitutions, admin tabs)
- PWA — not yet
- Deployment — Vercel + Convex configured ✅

## What Needs Work

- **Smart substitution suggestions** — current sub suggestions sort by playing time only; next step is position-aware filtering (prefer bench player whose positionPrimary matches the outgoing player's slot role, fallback to playing time)
- **Mobile UX polish** — coach interface works on phone but could benefit from UX audit
- **PWA** — offline resilience, installable on home screen
- **Match history stats** — history page exists, but post-match stat aggregation and player-level summaries not yet implemented
- **Test coverage** — component tests exist (Vitest + RTL), but Convex function tests and smoke test automation still needed

## TODO — Priority Task List

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **CSV Match Import** | Admin uploads a CSV file to bulk-create matches for the season. Approach TBD — options: (A) client-side CSV parse + call createMatch per row, (B) Convex action that accepts parsed rows in one call, (C) dedicated upload endpoint. CSV columns likely: team name, opponent, home/away, date/time, coach name/PIN, referee name (optional). Should validate rows, show preview before import, report errors per row. UI: new section in the Wedstrijden tab or a separate import modal. | ❌ Not started |
| **Playing Time View Filter** | When coach taps "Speeltijd", the player list should switch to show only on-field + bench players for that match (not all team players). Currently shows the full player list. | ❌ Not started |
| **Add Players to Active Match** | Coach should be able to add additional players to a match after creation (e.g. late arrivals, extra subs). Currently players are only set at match creation time. | ❌ Not started |
| **Coach Match Delete** | Allow coaches to delete their own scheduled (not started) matches | ❌ Not started |

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY / FUTURE

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **PWA Support** | Offline resilience, installable on home screen | ❌ Not started |
| **Match History Stats** | Post-match summaries, player stat aggregation | ❌ Not started |
| **Mobile UX Audit** | Professional review of pitch-side usability | ❌ Not started |
| **Named Login** | Replace PIN-only with name + PIN for audit trails | ❌ Not started |
| **Cumulative Clock** | Display game time 0-60 min instead of per-quarter | ❌ Not started |

## Follow-Up Items (from code review)

### ~~Critical — Security~~ (RESOLVED)

- ~~**Admin PIN exposed in client bundle**~~: **FIXED.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PIN` removed entirely. Admin login now verifies PIN server-side via `convex/adminAuth.ts` → `verifyAdminPinQuery`. PIN is stored in `sessionStorage` after successful server verification (cleared on tab close). All admin components read PIN from `src/lib/adminSession.ts` → `getAdminPin()`. The PIN never appears in the client JS bundle.

### Warnings — Code Quality

- **`as Id<"players">` casts in `convex/teams.ts`**: Lines ~58 and ~164 cast string keys from `Object.entries()` to `Id<"players">`. Pragmatic but bypasses type safety. Consider using typed player ID tracking from the start.
- **`convex/seed.ts` hardcoded PIN "9999"**: The seed script uses the default dev admin PIN. This is fine for development but should never reach production seeding. Consider reading from an env var or Convex environment config.

### Completed Features

- ~~**Pause/stop clock during quarter**~~: Coach and referee can pause/resume the match clock mid-quarter. Uses `pausedAt` / `accumulatedPauseTime` fields. Playing time tracking accounts for pauses. Mutations in `convex/clockActions.ts`.
- ~~**Referee role ("scheidsrechter")**~~: Global referee records in `referees` table. Admin creates referees (Admin Panel → Scheidsrechters tab). Coach assigns a referee to a match via `RefereeAssignment` dropdown. Referee uses their global PIN + match code to access `/scheidsrechter`. Controls clock (start/pause/resume/end quarter) and edits scores with optional shirt number tracking. Match view at `/scheidsrechter/match/[id]`. Distinct dark-gray nav with amber "SCHEIDSRECHTER" badge.
- ~~**Referee score editing**~~: Referee can +/- scores for both teams. On "+", optional shirt number prompt logs a lightweight goal event with `note: "Rugnummer: N"` so the coach can later resolve to a named player. Mutation in `convex/scoreActions.ts`.
- ~~**Wedstrijd Browser (homepage)**~~: Public match list on homepage, grouped by status (LIVE/GEPLAND/AFGELOPEN). Real-time via `listPublicMatches` query in `convex/publicQueries.ts`. Component: `src/components/MatchBrowser.tsx`. Clickable cards link to `/live/[code]`.
- ~~**Homepage simplification**~~: Code input removed as primary UI. MatchBrowser is now the hero element. Coach/referee login as secondary links below. Collapsible "Heb je een code?" for edge cases. "Vandaag live" link to standen page.
- ~~**Standen page (defaults to today)**~~: Minimal scoreboard at `/standen`. Defaults to **today's matches only** (live + finished today + scheduled today). `?alle=true` shows all matches. Toggle link between views. Supports `?team=` filter. Real-time score updates.
- ~~**Wedstrijdleider (Phase 1)**~~: Coaches can claim/release "match lead" role. Schema: `leadCoachId: v.optional(v.id("coaches"))` on matches. Mutations in `convex/matchLeadActions.ts`. UI: collapsible `MatchLeadBadge` in coach match view. Phase 1 = informational only, no permission enforcement yet.
- ~~**Admin Match Management**~~: Full CRUD for matches in admin panel. "Wedstrijden" is the first tab (default). Backend: `convex/adminMatches.ts` (listAllMatches, createMatch, updateMatch, deleteMatch), all adminPin-protected. Frontend: `MatchesTab.tsx` (list + filters), `MatchForm.tsx` (collapsible create form with team/coach/referee dropdowns, player auto-selection), `MatchRow.tsx` (status badges, referee warning indicator, inline delete confirmation), `PlayerSelector.tsx` (extracted checkbox grid). Inline referee edit panel. Cascade delete (matchPlayers + matchEvents). Shared code generation in `convex/helpers.ts`. Coach PIN stripped from admin API responses (security fix).

- ~~**PitchView field component**~~: Visual football field for the coach match page. SVG-based field lines (FIFA/KNVB accurate for 8-tal and 11-tal). EA FC-style player cards with role-based colors (K=amber, V=blue, M=green, A=red), avatar silhouettes, name bars, number badges. Formation connecting lines (dashed SVG). CSS perspective tilt (12deg). Tap-to-swap: tap two field players to exchange positions, tap field + bench to substitute. Uniform 90px card size (field and bench). Players spread across full field (y: 16-90%). Backend: `swapFieldPositions` mutation for atomic field swaps. Files: `FieldPlayerCard.tsx`, `FormationLines.tsx`, `FieldLines.tsx`, `PitchBench.tsx`, `PitchView.tsx`, `roleColors.ts`, `fieldConfig.ts`. Formations: 8v8 (3-3-1, 1-4-2-1, 1-3-2-2) and 11v11 (4-3-3) with formation line links.

## Current Work: Formations

**Branch:** `feature/clock-pause-and-referee`
**Focus:** Expanding the formation system — adding more formations, improving formation management UI, and position-aware features.

## Next Sprint — Tech Debt (from agent review 2026-02-14)

Findings from code-reviewer, test-agent, mobile-ux-auditor, and convex-specialist:

### Must Fix (before next feature work)

| Item | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Atomic bench-to-field swap | code-reviewer | Current PitchView fires 2 separate mutations for bench↔field sub (race condition risk). Create single `swapBenchField` mutation. |
| Mutation error handling | code-reviewer | All mutation calls in PitchView are fire-and-forget with no `.catch()`. Add error feedback (toast/status). |
| `fieldSlotIndex` validation | code-reviewer | No range/integer check on `assignPlayerToSlot`. Add `fieldSlotIndex >= 0 && Number.isInteger()` guard. |
| PitchView test coverage | test-agent | Zero tests for 8 new PitchView files. Priority: P0 pure function tests (`formations.ts`, `fieldConfig.ts`, `roleColors.ts`), P1 interaction tests. |
| Pre-existing test failures | test-agent | 31 pre-existing test failures (coach/page, CoachDashboard, TeamsTab) — unrelated to PitchView but need fixing. |

### Should Fix (UX polish)

| Item | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `backdropFilter: blur()` | mobile-ux-auditor | 8-11 blur layers on field cards drain battery over 60-90 min match. Replace with solid `rgba(15,23,42,0.95)`. |
| Role color contrast | mobile-ux-auditor | V(blue)/M(green)/A(red) name bars fail WCAG AA for white text in sunlight. Darken colors. |
| Font sizes | mobile-ux-auditor | Player name 11px, role label 10px, bench header 10px — below 14px minimum for pitch-side use. |
| Card overlap in 4-player formations | mobile-ux-auditor | Cards overlap 7-11px in `1-4-2-1` and `4-3-3` on 375px phones. Consider responsive card sizing. |
| Dropdown/toggle touch targets | mobile-ux-auditor | Formation `<select>` and Veld/Lijst buttons ~36px tall (below 44px minimum). Add `min-h-[44px]`. |
| Status text contrast | mobile-ux-auditor | `text-yellow-400` on `bg-gray-100` is ~1.2:1 contrast — invisible in sunlight. |
| No swap undo | mobile-ux-auditor | Accidental tap permanently commits swap. Consider 3-second undo toast. |

### Nice to Have

| Item | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| DRY name truncation | code-reviewer | Duplicated in `PitchView` (12 chars) and `FieldPlayerCard` (10 chars). Unify. |
| DRY `PlayerIcon` SVG | code-reviewer | Duplicated in `FieldPlayerCard` and `PitchBench`. Extract shared component. |
| `React.memo` on cards | code-reviewer | Wrap `FieldPlayerCard` and `MiniCard` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. |
| Bench role labels | mobile-ux-auditor | Bench MiniCards lack role text label (KEP/VER/MID/AAN). Only color distinguishes role. |
| Haptic feedback on swap | mobile-ux-auditor | `navigator.vibrate(50)` after successful swap for tactile confirmation. |

### Future Features

- **Named login (user accounts)**: Replace anonymous PIN-only auth with name + PIN login. Users would be identifiable (e.g., "Coach Mike logged in") instead of just a PIN. Enables: personal dashboards, audit trails ("who made this change?"), multi-device sessions, and per-user preferences. Could start simple (name stored on coach record, displayed after PIN login) and evolve toward full accounts later.
- **Cumulative clock mode**: Display game time cumulatively across quarters (e.g., 0–60 min) instead of per-quarter (0–15 min). Should be a coach setting per match. Next priority.
- **Seed data expansion**: Currently seeds 4 coaches, 4 referees, 3 teams with 14 players each, 3 matches with referee assignments. Modular seed system in `convex/seed/`. Run `npx convex run seed:init`. Needs further expansion (more realistic season data, CSV import integration).
- **Opponent roster support**: Store rosters for both teams (not just ours). Enables sharing match data (goals, events, stats) with both teams afterwards. Shirt numbers stored by the referee in goal events can then be resolved to named players for either team.
- **Own goal registration**: In youth football, own goals happen by accident. Currently not tracked as a distinct event type. When needed, add an `isOwnGoal` flow to the GoalModal (separate from opponent goals) with appropriate score handling. Low priority for kindervoetbal — coaches generally don't want to single out a child.
- **Goal ownership split (coach vs referee)**: When a referee is actively assigned and controlling a match, the **coach should no longer be able to add new goals** — only the referee enters scores/goals. However, the coach **should still be able to edit goal details** (e.g., add or correct the player name on a goal that the referee registered with only a shirt number). This keeps the referee as the single source of truth for scoring, while the coach enriches the data afterwards with player names. Requires: (1) a check on coach goal mutations: if `match.refereeId` is set, reject new goals from coach; (2) a new "edit goal event" mutation for the coach to update `playerId`/`playerName` on existing goal events; (3) UI changes in the coach GoalModal to show "referee-controlled" state.
- **Full score editing (coach)**: Allow coach to manually set home/away score directly, for situations where the app gets out of sync with the real match. (Referee score editing already implemented.)
- **Quarter time warning**: When elapsed time exceeds the expected quarter duration (e.g., 15 min), show a visual/audio warning to the coach. Not a hard stop, just a nudge. Useful when the coach loses track of time pitch-side.

## Subagent Workflow

When working with AI subagents on this project, follow this workflow at the end of **every phase**:

### Phase Completion Checklist

1. **Primary agents** complete their tasks (e.g., `convex-specialist`, `frontend-designer`)
2. **`code-reviewer`** reviews all changes before handoff:
   - 300 LOC file limit
   - No `any` types
   - PIN security on mutations
   - Proper Convex patterns
3. **`test-agent`** creates/runs tests:
   - Unit tests for new code
   - Smoke test checklists for manual verification
   - All tests must pass before handoff
4. **`debugger`** (if needed) investigates any failures

### Available Subagents

**Always verify locally before pushing to GitHub.** Vercel deploys automatically on push, so a broken push means a broken deploy.

1. **Run the build locally first:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This runs the exact same TypeScript type-checking and compilation that Vercel does. Fix any errors before proceeding.

2. **Test the app locally** (if build passes):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Spot-check key flows: coach login, match creation, live view.

3. **Wait for human approval before pushing.**
   Agents (subagents, AI assistants) must **never** push to GitHub on their own. Only the human operator decides when to push. This prevents conflicting pushes, broken deploys, and race conditions when multiple agents are working in parallel.

4. **Only push when the human says go:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "description of changes"
   git push
   ```

### Git Rules for Agents

- **Commits are fine** — agents may freely commit to the local branch.
- **Pushes require human approval** — never run `git push` unless the human explicitly asks for it.
- **No force pushes** — never use `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease` unless the human explicitly requests it.
- **Coordinate via commits** — when multiple agents work in parallel, each should commit their changes locally. The human merges and resolves any conflicts before pushing.

This avoids wasted Vercel build minutes, broken deployments, and conflicting pushes between agents.

## Environment & Deployment

### Local Development (.env.local)

These are set automatically by `npx convex dev` and stored in `.env.local` (gitignored):

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` | `dev:your-project-123` | Points `convex dev` at your dev backend |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | `https://your-project-123.convex.cloud` | Connects React client to Convex |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Site URL for local dev |

No `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` is needed locally — `convex dev` handles syncing.

### Vercel Deployment (Environment Variables)

**CRITICAL: `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` must be scoped to Production only.**

| Variable | Vercel Scope | Value Source | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` | **Production ONLY** | Convex Dashboard → Settings → Deploy Keys → generate "Production" key (starts with `prod:`) | Authenticates `convex deploy` during production builds |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | **All Environments** | Convex Dashboard → Settings → URL | Connects the React client to Convex in every build |

**Why Production only?** Vercel creates **preview** deployments for every PR/branch push. If `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` is set for "All Environments", Convex CLI detects a production key in a non-production context and **refuses to deploy** with error:
```
✖ Detected a non-production build environment and "CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY"
  for a production Convex deployment. This is probably unintentional.
```

### How the Build Script Works (`scripts/build.mjs`)

The build script (`npm run build`) is **not** a raw `convex deploy` command. It's a conditional script:

```
npm run build
    │
    ▼
  scripts/build.mjs checks environment
    │
    ├─ CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY + VERCEL_ENV=production
    │    → npx convex deploy --cmd "next build"
    │    → Deploys Convex functions AND builds Next.js
    │
    ├─ CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY + VERCEL_ENV=preview
    │    → npx next build (only)
    │    → Builds Next.js using existing NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
    │    → Does NOT touch Convex backend
    │
    └─ No CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY (local)
         → npx next build (only)
```

This means:
- **Production deploys** (push to `main`) deploy Convex functions + build frontend — full atomic deploy
- **Preview deploys** (PRs, branches) only build the frontend — safe, no backend changes
- **Local builds** just build Next.js — use `convex dev` for backend sync

### Vercel Setup

`CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` is scoped to **Production only** in Vercel. Preview deployments build the frontend only (no backend changes). This is the correct configuration.
